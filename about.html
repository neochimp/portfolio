            <div class="text">
                My name is Cameron Lee, I am currently a fourth year computer science student in 
                my hometown at San Diego State University. I love learning and absorbing as much as I can from
                those around me. I am extremely passionate in computer science and the tech industry as a whole. 
                I'm currently studying to get my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science and I hope to have 
                the opportunity to complete my Master's somewhere that I can learn and grow to my fullest potential. 
                I am a full time student but I also work full time to support myself, so unfortunately I don't get 
                to dedicate as much time as I'd like to the passion, but I still find the time whenever I can :). 
                If you'd like to know more about me, or would just like to chat you can reach out to me 
                <a href="contact.html">here!</a>

                There are a few topics that if brought up, you could not stop me from yapping about. The big 
                ones include, but are not limited to: video games, music, food, aquariums, mycology, and the 
                meaning of life. The TL;DR is: I love making video games; I play the drums and have played in 
                a few small bands; I am a huge foodie and will eat just about anything (my favorites are sushi,
                mexican food, and wings); I love aquariums and aquascaping, I mainly keep Cherry Shrimp (Neocaridina);
                I find mycology (study of mushrooms) super interesting and have become obsessed with breeding
                mycelium cultures on agar plates; I love discussing life & the world around us, and having my ideas 
                challenged. I think we are always changing and I enjoy discovering new perspectives.

            <div class="subtitle">Video Games</div>
            <div class="text">
                I've always loved video games from a young age. I grew up with hand-me-down nintendo consoles and 
                playing on the Xbox with my dad. Pokemon was my go-to as a kid, and when I finally got my own 
                laptop one of the first games I got into was Starcraft II, my dad had played Starcraft throughout 
                college and I often watched him play from a young age. The next game I got incredibly sucked into 
                was Minecraft. Like most kids my age, I loved watching Minecraft Youtubers and the moment I could 
                play it myself, I sunk countless hours into it. My favorite genre of game, which I draw major 
                inspiration from, is the beautiful world of Roguelikes. Games like The Binding of Isaac, Enter
                The Gungeon, FTL, Dome of the Keeper, and Nubby's Number Factory are all some of my favorite 
                games that are definitely worth checking out.

            <div class="text">
                I feel that video games are a beautiful form of expression that can bring experiences like no other.
                Video Games can truly transport you into new worlds and experiences and provide both strong emotions,
                and silly entertainment. The art of video games is something that is incredibly unique and I feel 
                a strong sense to preserve. Following this, me and my best friend 
                <a href="https://jasonheflinger.com/">Jason</a>, have decided to take our love and passion for 
                video games and to channel that into our own vision. Together, we created our game studio,
                <a href="https://greedygauntlet.com/">Greedy Gauntlet</a>. We haven't put anything official out yet,
                but be on the lookout because there will be big things coming.

            <div class="subtitle">Spirituality</div>
            <div class="text">
                Outside of my work in computer science, I'm deeply interested in introspection,
                meditation, and philosphy. I was raised a Vietnamese American, so naturally I 
                grew up in Mahāyāna Buddhist tradition, with its rich emphasis on compassion, 
                balance, and ancestral connection. While I initally engaged in rituals out of
                cultural rhythm rather than personal connection, those early experiences planted the seeds
                of a deep inner curiosity. 
            </div>
            <div class="text">
                Today, my spiritual views are more personal and self-defined. They're shaped through meditation,
                self-introspection, and a blend of Buddhist, Taoist, and Existential ideas. 
                I believe in a kind of energetic interconnectedness, and that meaning is not
                something inherently given to us, but rather something we have to define for 
                ourselves. Medition, for me, isn't an escape. It is a dialogue with the unknown.
                A space to question, to reflect, and to make peace with uncertainty.
            </div>
            <div class="text">
                This mindset guides how I approach both life and technology: with intentionality,
                humility, and a sense that even in a universe devoid of meaning, we  can still
                have the power to build systems, <div class="it">and lives</div>, with intention,
                thoughtfulness, integrity, and balance.
