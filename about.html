            <div class="text">
                My name is Cameron Lee, I am currently a fourth year computer science student in 
                my hometown at San Diego State University.

            <div class="text">
                Outside of my work in computer science, I'm deeply interested in introspection,
                meditation, and philosphy. I was raised a Vietnamese American, so naturally I 
                grew up in Mahāyāna Buddhist tradition, with its rich emphasis on compassion, 
                balance, and ancestral connection. While I initally engaged in rituals out of
                cultural rhythm rather than personal connection, those early experiences planted the seeds
                of a deep inner curiosity. 
            </div>
            <div class="text">
                Today, my spiritual views are more personal. They're shaped through meditation,
                self-introspection, and a blend of Buddhist, Taoist, and Existential ideas. 
                I believe in a kind of energetic interconnectedness, and that meaning is not
                something inherently given to us, but rather something we have to define for 
                ourselves. Medition, for me, isn't an escape. It is a dialogue with the unknown.
                A space to question, to reflect, and to make peace with uncertainty.
            </div>
            <div class="text">
                This mindset guides how I approach both life and technology: with intentionality,
                humility, and a sense that even in a universe devoid of meaning, we  can still
                have the power to build systems, <div class="it">and lives</div>, with intention,
                thoughtfulness, integrity, and balance.
