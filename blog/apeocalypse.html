      <div class="subtitle">Preface</div><br>
      <div class="text it cent">
        This semester at SDSU, I'm taking CS583: 3D Game Programming. This class has been a blast so far and has been really cool to get industry insights from Christopher Fodor, a
        current employee at Sony Entertainment with tons of experience in the game industry. And, while this class is called <div class="it">3D</div> Game Programming, before you
        can run you must walk!
      </div>

      <div class="subtitle">The Concept</div>
      <div class="text">
        Ah, where every good project begins....the concept. I originally came up with APEocalypse, largely as a joke, last year, while chatting with some friends. A new meme
        had been making its rounds at the time, discussing who would win in a battle: 100 Unarmed Men vs 1 Gorilla. Now while I am no expert on primates, I personally feel like 100 men
        could easily take down one gorilla. With this in mind I proposed a more interesting question to my friends: 
        <br><br>Would 10 men <div class="it">of your choice be able to take on a gorilla?</div> <br><br>
        This question got plenty of discussion revolving. Could 10x Mike Tyson's fight a gorilla? What about having olympic distance runners to tire out the gorilla? Would
        the inclusion of an animal expert giving guidance and direction make a difference?
        <br><br>
        From this question emerged another. Assuming that your perfect team of 10 people could defeat a gorilla, just <div class="it">how many</div> gorillas could they defeat?
      </div>
         
      <div class="subtitle">Enter APEocalypse</div>
      <div class="text">
          The concept is simple, survive as many waves as you can
