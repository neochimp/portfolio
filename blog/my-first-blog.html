            <div class="subtitle">Preface</div><br>
            <div class="text it cent">
                I was in desperate need of a website. It was something I had been putting off for far too long
            </div>
            <div class="subtitle">What's the point?</div>
            <div class="text">
                The ultimate goal of this website is to serve as a personal
                portfolio. I needed a central place to showcase and discuss projects.
                I figured it'd look pretty good and super professional to have a website
                I could link on my resume or send to somebody who's curious what I'm up to.
            </div>
            <div class="subtitle">Why a blog?</div>
            <div class="text">
                I wanted to have a separate place for projects and blogs so that
                I could keep the important things in one place, and set my ramblings
                aside elsewhere. There's no real hard topics I'm trying to focus on
                but I'm going to try to mostly keep the subjects around tech
                related topics. If I had to make a distinction, I'd say projects is 
                where you will find information and  blogs is where you'll find opinions.
            </div>
            <div class="subtitle">Did you make this website?</div>
            <div class="text">
                Hell yeah! Despite me not being a big fan of web development, my 
                stubborness led me to build this website brick by brick with my bare
                hands. Everything you see here I wrote myself using HTML, CSS, and 
                JavaScript. Some of this stuff would've probably been easier if I
                had used a framework or a website builder but where's the fun in that.
                Also, huge shoutout to my best friend 
                <a href="https://jasonheflinger.com/">Jason</a>, he was a big help 
                with some frustrating "center div" style problems and he gave me 
                some great feedback on my design.
